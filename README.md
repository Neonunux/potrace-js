potrace-js

A javascript implementation of Peter Selinger's raster to vector image 
converter potrace (http://potrace.sourceforge.net/), originally 
implemented in C.

The vague intention is to eventually create a javascript web app, using
HTML5 canvas either for simple drawings, or the option to upload images
(of reasonable size, please, heh), and returning SVG vector versions
which, may I point out, are built directly into HTML5.

Tested in Chrome v21.0.1180.75.

Python may have existed at some point.
(See [thomasballinger](https://github.com/thomasballinger/)'s [potrace-python](https://github.com/thomasballinger/potrace-python/).)

Developed during hackerschool, summer 2012.
